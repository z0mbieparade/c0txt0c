  <p>The original problem was that to create colors in IRC, you need to insert an
  invisible unicode color character. Which, is a massive plain in the butt.
  Especially on a Mac. A while back I wrote a command line script that would
  take a text file with <span class="fg09">&lime</span> and convert every
  <span class="fg09">&lime</span> to its corresponding lime green invisible unicode
  character (\u00039), and spit out another text file you could then upload and
  use as the MOTD on an IRC server. Which, was great but also still a huge pain
  in the butt.</p>

  <p>So... here's a front end for my old
    <a href="https://github.com/z0mbieparade/c0lorize" target="_blank">c0lorize command line app</a>.
    A few useful points of interest:</p>

  <p>The <span class="settings_icon"></span> icon on the right lets you change the text
    editor settings. You can upload a background image to "trace" with whatever
    text you want. You can adjust the background color and font color and any
    number of other things that might make your life easier when hand-drawing ascii art.</p>

  <p>The <span class="convert_icon"></span> icon next to it is if you want to
    run aalib over the background image you've uploaded. It's not perfect,
    and the colors are restricted to the 16 foreground/background colors IRC
    allows, so it can get pretty wacky looking. There are multiple settings
    you can fiddle with to try and make something not horrible looking. Keep
    in mind, clicking <b>[Convert Image to ASCII]</b> will erase anything you
    currently have in your editor.</p>

  <p>The <span class="filter_icon"></span> icon contains a bunch of filters you can use.</p>

  <p>The toggle switch next to the <span class="settings_icon"></span> that
    swaps from colored to text, shows you the original plain text format that
    the original c0lorize script used. You can download this by clicking the
    <b>[Download Text]</b> button at the top.</p>

  <p><b>[Download HTML]</b> downloads an html file of what you made, incase
    you want to use it on the web somewhere.</p>

  <p><b>[Download IRC]</b> downloads the IRC text file with unicode colors.</p>

  <p>There are a couple demo files you can check out up there too if you want
    an idea of how everything works, or some inspiration.</p>

  <p>For more info about colors, color codes, etc you can check out the about
    page on the original <a href="https://github.com/z0mbieparade/c0lorize" target="_blank">c0lorize app</a>.</p>
